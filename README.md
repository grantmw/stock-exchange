## About

Users have a clean interface to interact with an order book. After searching for a stock symbol, users can view, buy, and sell stocks. Purchased stocks are added to a user portfolio where they can be viewed and sold.(The application was built using React and Redux, and utilizes a public API for all stock information.)

Currently the application is deployed on [Heroku](https://grants-stock-echange.herokuapp.com/).
