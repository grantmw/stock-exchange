# stock-exchange
A small widget for viewing, buying, and selling stocks



## About

The application was built using React and Redux. Users have a nice interface to interact with an order book. After searching for a stock symbol, users can view, buy, and sell stocks. Purchased stocks are added to a portfolio where they can be viewed and sold. 

Currently the application is deployed on [Heroku](https://grants-stock-echange.herokuapp.com/).
